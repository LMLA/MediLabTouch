        "commonQuestions": "1. What can a patient do about his CBC?\nPatients who have a keen interest in their own health care frequently want to know what they can do to change their WBCs, RBCs, and platelets. Unlike “good” and “bad” cholesterol, cell populations are not generally affected by lifestyle changes unless the patient has an underlying deficiency (such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency or iron deficiency). There is no way that a patient can directly raise the number of his WBCs or change the size or shape of his RBCs. Addressing any underlying diseases or conditions and following a healthy lifestyle will help optimize your body’s cell production and your body will take care of the rest.",

        "patientGeneralInfo": "Why Get Tested?\nTo determine general health status and to screen for and monitor a variety of disorders, such as anemia\n\nWhen to Get Tested?\nAs part of a routine medical exam or as determined by your doctor\n\nSample Required?\nA blood sample drawn from a vein in the arm or a fingerstick or heelstick (newborns)\n\nTest Preparation Needed?\nNone",
        "patientTestSample": "What is being tested?\nThe Complete Blood Count (CBC) test is an automated count of the cells in the blood. A standard CBC includes the following:\n\nnumber of white blood cells (WBC)\nnumber of red blood cells (RBC)\nhemoglobin content (Hgb)\nhematocrit (Hct)\nmean corpuscular volume (MCV)\nmean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)\nmean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)\nplatelet count and volume\nThe results of a CBC can provide information about not only the number of cell types but also can give an indication of the size, shape, and some of the physical characteristics of the cells. In addition, a WBC differential (identifies different types of WBCs) may be ordered and can be done on the same instrument or performed manually.\n\nSignificant abnormalities in one or more of the cell populations may require visual confirmation by observing a blood smear under a microscope. In this test, a drop of blood is placed on a glass slide, smeared into a thin layer, allowed to dry, and then dyed with a special stain. A Clinical Laboratory Scientist can then evaluate the physical characteristics of the red and white blood cells present. Any additional information is noted and reported to the doctor.\n\nBlood consists of cells suspended in a liquid called plasma. These cells - the RBCs, WBCs, and platelets - are produced and mature primarily in the bone marrow. Under normal circumstances, they are released into the bloodstream as needed.\n\nWhite Blood Cells (WBCs)\nThere are five different types of WBCs that the body uses to maintain a healthy state and to fight infections or other causes of injury. They are neutrophils, lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. They are present in the blood at relatively stable percentages. These numbers may temporarily shift higher or lower depending on what is going on in the body. For instance, an infection can stimulate a higher concentration of neutrophils (a “shift to the left”) to fight off bacterial infection. With allergies, there may be an increased number of eosinophils that release certain chemicals (anti-histamines) that minimize the allergic effect. Lymphocytes may be stimulated to produce immunoglobulins (antibodies). And in certain disease states, such as leukemia, abnormal and immature white cells (blasts) rapidly multiply, increasing the WBC count.\n\nRed Blood Cells (RBCs)\nRBCs are pale red in color and shaped like a donut with a thinner section in the middle instead of a hole. They have hemoglobin inside them, a protein that transports oxygen throughout the body. The CBC determines whether there are sufficient RBCs present and whether the population of RBCs appears to be normal. RBCs are normally all the same size and shape; however, variations can occur with vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, iron deficiency, and with a variety of other conditions. If there are insufficient normal RBCs present, the patient is said to have anemia and may have symptoms such as fatigue and weakness. Much less frequently, there may be too many RBCs in the blood (erythrocytosis or polycythemia). In extreme cases, this can interfere with the flow of blood through the veins and arteries.\n\nPlatelets\nPlatelets are special cell fragments that play an important role in blood clotting. If a patient does not have enough platelets, he will be at an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. The CBC measures the number and size of platelets present. With some conditions and in some people, there may be giant platelets or platelet clumps that are difficult for the hematology instrument to accurately measure. In this case, a blood smear test may be necessary.\n\nHow is the sample collected for testing?\nThe CBC is performed on a blood sample taken by a needle placed in a vein in the arm or by a fingerstick (for children and adults) or heelstick (for infants).\n\nNOTE: If undergoing medical tests makes you or someone you care for anxious, embarrassed, or even difficult to manage, you might consider reading one or more of the following articles: Coping with Test Pain, Discomfort, and Anxiety, Tips on Blood Testing, Tips to Help Children through Their Medical Tests, and Tips to Help the Elderly through Their Medical Tests.\n\nAnother article, Follow That Sample, provides a glimpse at the collection and processing of a blood sample and throat culture.\n\nIs any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?\nNo test preparation is needed.",

        "theTest": "How is it used?\nThe complete blood count or CBC test is used as a broad screening test to check for such disorders as anemia, infection, and many other diseases. It is actually a panel of tests that examines different parts of the blood and includes the following:\n\nWhite blood cell (WBC) count is a count of the actual number of white blood cells per volume of blood. Both increases and decreases can be significant.\nWhite blood cell differential looks at the types of white blood cells present. There are five different types of white blood cells, each with its own function in protecting us from infection. The differential classifies a person's white blood cells into each type: neutrophils (also known as segs, PMNs, granulocytes, grans), lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\nRed blood cell (RBC) count is a count of the actual number of red blood cells per volume of blood. Both increases and decreases can point to abnormal conditions.\nHemoglobin measures the amount of oxygen-carrying protein in the blood.\nHematocrit measures the percentage of red blood cells in a given volume of whole blood.\nThe platelet count is the number of platelets in a given volume of blood. Both increases and decreases can point to abnormal conditions of excess bleeding or clotting. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a machine-calculated measurement of the average size of your platelets. New platelets are larger, and an increased MPV occurs when increased numbers of platelets are being produced. MPV gives your doctor information about platelet production in your bone marrow.\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the average size of your RBCs. The MCV is elevated when your RBCs are larger than normal (macrocytic), for example in anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. When the MCV is decreased, your RBCs are smaller than normal (microcytic) as is seen in iron deficiency anemia or thalassemias.\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is a calculation of the average amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin inside a red blood cell. Macrocytic RBCs are large so tend to have a higher MCH, while microcytic red cells would have a lower value.\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is a calculation of the average concentration of hemoglobin inside a red cell. Decreased MCHC values (hypochromia) are seen in conditions where the hemoglobin is abnormally diluted inside the red cells, such as in iron deficiency anemia and in thalassemia. Increased MCHC values (hyperchromia) are seen in conditions where the hemoglobin is abnormally concentrated inside the red cells, such as in burn patients and hereditary spherocytosis, a relatively rare congenital disorder.\nRed cell distribution width (RDW) is a calculation of the variation in the size of your RBCs. In some anemias, such as pernicious anemia, the amount of variation (anisocytosis) in RBC size (along with variation in shape – poikilocytosis) causes an increase in the RDW.\n^ Back to top\n\nWhen is it ordered?\nThe CBC is a very common test. Many patients will have baseline CBC tests to help determine their general health status. If they are healthy and they have cell populations that are within normal limits, then they may not require another CBC until their health status changes or until their doctor feels that it is necessary.\n\nIf a patient is having symptoms such as fatigue or weakness or has an infection, inflammation, bruising, or bleeding, then the doctor may order a CBC to help diagnose the cause. Significant increases in WBCs may help confirm that an infection is present and suggest the need for further testing to identify its cause. Decreases in the number of RBCs (anemia) can be further evaluated by changes in size or shape of the RBCs to help determine if the cause might be decreased production, increased loss, or increased destruction of RBCs. A platelet count that is low or extremely high may confirm the cause of excessive bleeding or clotting and can also be associated with diseases of the bone marrow such as leukemia.\n\nMany conditions will result in increases or decreases in the cell populations. Some of these conditions may require treatment, while others will resolve on their own. Some diseases, such as cancer (and chemotherapy treatment), can affect bone marrow production of cells, increasing the production of one cell at the expense of others or decreasing overall cell production. Some medications can decrease WBC counts while some vitamin and mineral deficiencies can cause anemia. The CBC test may be ordered by the doctor on a regular basis to monitor these conditions and drug treatments.\n\n^ Back to top\n\nWhat does the test result mean?\n\n\nThe following table explains what increases or decreases in each of the components of the CBC may mean. \n\nExpand TableComponents of the CBC\nTEST\tNAME\t INCREASED/DECREASED\nWBC\tWhite Blood Cell\tMay be increased with infections, inflammation, cancer, leukemia; decreased with some medications (such as methotrexate), some autoimmune conditions, some severe infections, bone marrow failure, and congenital marrow aplasia (marrow doesn't develop normally)\n% Neutrophil\nNeutrophil/Band/Seg/Gran\nThis is a dynamic population that varies somewhat from day to day depending on what is going on in the body.

        "patientTestSample": "What is being tested?\nBlood consists of a few types of cells, including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets, suspended in a fluid portion called plasma. A hematocrit is a test that measures the proportion of a person's blood that is made up of RBCs. It is a ratio of the volume of red blood cells to the volume of whole blood. The value is expressed as a percentage or fraction. For example, a hematocrit value of 40% means that there are 40 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood.\n\nThe hematocrit is a fairly quick and simple way of evaluating a person's red blood cells. It is often performed in conjunction with a hemoglobin level and is also one component of the complete blood count (CBC), a test that is often used in the general evaluation of a person's health.\n\nRBCs are produced in the bone marrow and are released into the bloodstream after they mature. They typically make up roughly 37% to 49% of the volume of blood. RBCs contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen. The primary function of RBCs is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs of the body. They also transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a byproduct of cell metabolism from tissues and organs back to the lungs, where it is expelled. The bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days. There are a number of conditions that can affect either the production of new RBCs or the lifespan of those in circulation or that result in significant bleeding.\n\nThe hematocrit reflects both the number of red cells and their volume (mean corpuscular volume or MCV). If the size of the red cells decreases, so will the hematocrit and vice versa. In general, the hematocrit will rise when the number of red blood cells increases and the hematocrit will fall to less than normal when there is a drop in production of RBCs by the bone marrow, an increase in the destruction of RBCs, or if blood is lost due to bleeding. A drop in the RBC count, hemoglobin and hematocrit can result in anemia, a condition in which the body does not have the capacity to deliver enough oxygen to tissues and organs, causing fatigue and weakness. If too many RBCs are produced (resulting in increased hematocrit), then the blood can become thickened, causing sluggish blood flow and related problems.\n\nHow is the sample collected for testing?\nA sample is obtained by drawing blood through a needle placed in a vein in the arm or by a fingerstick (for children and adults) or a heelstick (for newborns).\n\nNOTE: If undergoing medical tests makes you or someone you care for anxious, embarrassed, or even difficult to manage, you might consider reading one or more of the following articles: Coping with Test Pain, Discomfort, and Anxiety, Tips on Blood Testing, Tips to Help Children through Their Medical Tests, and Tips to Help the Elderly through Their Medical Tests.\n\nAnother article, Follow That Sample, provides a glimpse at the collection and processing of a blood sample and throat culture.\n\nIs any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?\nNo test preparation is needed.",

In addition to the full CBC, some other tests that may be performed at the same time or as follow up to establish a cause include a blood smear, reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate levels, and in more severe conditions, a bone marrow examination.\n\n^ Back to top\n\nWhen is it ordered?\nThe hematocrit is routinely ordered as a part of the complete blood count (CBC). It may also be ordered by itself or with a hemoglobin level as part of a general health examination. These tests are often ordered when a person has signs and symptoms of a condition affecting RBCs, such as anemia and polycythemia.\n\nSome signs and symptoms of anemia include:\n\nWeakness or fatigue\nLack of energy\nFainting\nPaleness (pallor)\nShortness of breath\nSome signs and symptoms of polycythemia include:\n\nDisturbed vision\nDizziness\nHeadache\nFlushing\nEnlarged spleen\nIt may sometimes be ordered when someone has signs and symptoms of serious dehydration, such as extreme thirst, dry mouth or mucous membranes, and lack of sweating or urination.\n\nThis test may be performed several times or on a regular basis when someone has been diagnosed with ongoing bleeding problems or chronic anemias or polycythemia to determine the effectiveness of treatment. It may also be ordered routinely on patients undergoing treatment for cancer that is known to affect the bone marrow.\n\n^ Back to top\n\nWhat does the test result mean?\nRed blood cells typically make up roughly 37% to 49% of the volume of blood.\n\nSince a hematocrit is often performed as part of a CBC, results from other components are taken into consideration. A rise or drop in the hematocrit must be interpreted in conjunction with other parameters, such as RBC count, hemoglobin, reticulocyte count and/or red blood cell indices. Age, gender, and race are other factors to be considered. In general, the hematocrit mirrors the results of the RBC count and hemoglobin.\n\nSome causes of a low hematocrit include:\n\nExcessive destruction of red blood cells, for example, hemolytic anemia caused by autoimmunity or defects in the red cell itself; the defects could be hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell anemia), abnormalities in the RBC membrane (e.g., hereditary spherocytosis) or RBC enzyme (e.g., G6PD deficiency)\nDecreased production of hemoglobin (e.g., thalassemia)\nAcute or chronic bleeding from the digestive tract (e.g., ulcers, polyps, colon cancer) or other sites, such as the bladder, uterus (in women, heavy menstrual bleeding, for example), or from severe trauma\nNutritional deficiencies such as iron, folate or B12 deficiency\nDamage to the bone marrow from, for example, a toxin, radiation or chemotherapy, infection or drugs\nKidney failure—severe and chronic kidney diseases lead to decreased production of erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates RBC production by the bone marrow.\nChronic inflammatory diseases or conditions\nBone marrow disorders such as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or other cancers that spread to the marrow\nSome causes of a high hematocrit include:\n\nDehydration—this is the most common cause of a high hematocrit. As the volume of fluid in the blood drops, the RBCs per volume of fluid artificially rises; with adequate fluid intake, the hematocrit returns to normal.\nPolycythemia vera—a rare disease in which the body produces excess RBCs inappropriately\nLung (pulmonary) disease—if someone is unable to breathe in and absorb sufficient oxygen, the body tries to compensate by producing more red blood cells.\nCongenital heart disease—in some forms, there is an abnormal connection between the two sides of the heart, leading to reduced oxygen levels in the blood.

        "commonQuestions": "1. How treatable are abnormal red blood cell counts?\nFirst, your doctor must determine the cause of your abnormal RBC count so he can prescribe appropriate treatment. For some anemias, treatment may include a dietary supplement or a change in your diet to include nutritional foods. In some instances, it may only require a change in your current medication. For more severe cases, treatment may involve transfusion with blood from a donor. For some, prescribing a drug to stimulate red cell production in the bone marrow may be required, especially in people who have received chemotherapy or radiation treatments.\n\n2. Can my RBC count be tested at my doctor’s office?\nMaybe. Some doctors' offices are equipped with laboratory instruments and staffed by trained laboratorians who are able to perform this test. \n\n3. Do diet and nutrition help keep RBCs at healthy levels?\nYes, to the extent that if you eat a well-balanced diet, you can prevent anemia due to a lack of iron, vitamin B12, or folate in the foods you eat. Sometimes use of a supplement is recommended if you are at risk of a vitamin deficiency. However, the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is malabsorption, and the most common cause of iron deficiency is bleeding. These conditions and other RBC problems that are caused by diseases other than nutritional deficiencies will not be corrected by diet. \n\n4. Are there symptoms I should recognize if my RBCs are dangerously low or high?\nFatigue may indicate a low or high RBC count.

        "commonQuestions": "1. Can a WBC count be performed on a sample other than blood?\nYes. WBC counts may be performed on many different types of body fluids. A common reason that this is done is to more directly assess one area of the body that may be infected or inflamed. For example, if meningitis is suspected, then a WBC count plus differential may be performed on a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Many other examples are listed in the article on Body Fluid Analysis.\n\n2. If I have an abnormal WBC count, what other tests might my doctor order?\nOther general tests to check your health may include a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). Depending on your signs, symptoms, medical history, physical exam and suspected condition, your doctor may choose to order a variety of other tests. A few general examples include:\n\n•\tBacterial infection: a culture of the affected area (e.g., urine culture, sputum culture, blood culture), strep test\n\n•\tViral infection: tests for mononucleosis, EBV\n\n•\tInflammation: CRP, ESR\n\n•\tAutoimmune diseases: ANA\n\n•\tAllergies: Allergy tests\n\n•\tLeukemia: Bone marrow biopsy, immunophenotyping (e.g., flow cytometry), chromosome analysis",

        "patientTestSample": "What is being tested?\nWhite blood cells, also called leukocytes, are cells that exist in the blood, the lymphatic system, and tissues and are an important part of the body's defense system. They help protect against infections and also have a role in inflammation, allergic responses, and protecting against cancer. The white blood cell (WBC) count totals the number of white blood cells in a person's sample of blood. It is one test among several that is included in a complete blood count (CBC), which is often used in the general evaluation of a person's health.\n\nBlood is made up of a few different types of cells suspended in fluid called plasma. In addition to WBCs, there are red blood cells and platelets. These cells are produced in the bone marrow and subsequently released into the blood to circulate. There are five types of WBCs, and each has a different function.\n\nThree types of WBCs are referred to as \"granulocytes\" because of the granules present in their cytoplasm. These granules release chemicals and other substances as part of the immune response. Granulocytes include neutrophils, which normally make up the largest number of circulating WBCs, eosinophils, and basophils. The other two types of WBCs are monocytes and lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are further divided into three subtypes: B lymphocytes that produces antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins), T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells (NK cells).\n\nWhen there is an infection or an inflammatory process somewhere in the body, the bone marrow produces more WBCs, releasing them into the blood, and through a complex process, they move to the site of infection or inflammation. As the condition resolves, the production of WBCs by the bone marrow subsides and the number of WBCs drops to normal levels again.\n\nIn addition to infections and inflammation, there are a number of conditions that can affect the production of WBCs by the bone marrow or the survival of WBCs in the blood, such as cancer or an immune disorder, resulting in either increased or decreased numbers of WBCs in the blood. The WBC count, along with the other components of the CBC, alerts the doctor to possible health issues. Results are often interpreted in conjunction with additional tests such as a WBC differential and a blood smear review. A differential may inform the doctor as to which type of WBC may be low or high, and a blood smear can reveal the presence of abnormal and/or immature populations of WBCs.\n\nIf results indicate a problem, a wide variety of other tests maybe performed in order to help determine the cause. A doctor will typically consider an individual's signs and symptoms, medical history, and results of a physical examination to decide what other tests may be necessary. For example, as needed, a bone marrow biopsy will be performed to evaluate the bone marrow status.\n\nHow is the sample collected for testing?\nThe blood sample is obtained by a needle placed in a vein in the arm or a fingerstick (for children and adults) or heelstick (for newborns).\n\nNOTE: If undergoing medical tests makes you or someone you care for anxious, embarrassed, or even difficult to manage, you might consider reading one or more of the following articles: Coping with Test Pain, Discomfort, and Anxiety, Tips on Blood Testing, Tips to Help Children through Their Medical Tests, and Tips to Help the Elderly through Their Medical Tests.\n\nAnother article, Follow That Sample, provides a glimpse at the collection and processing of a blood sample and throat culture.\n\nIs any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?\nNo test preparation is needed.",

Other conditions affect the production of WBCs by the bone marrow or the survival of WBCs in the circulation, resulting in either an increase or decrease in the number of circulating WBCs. A WBC count can indicate that there is a disease or condition affecting white blood cells, but it cannot determine the underlying cause. Several other tests may be performed at the same time or in follow up to an abnormal result to help make a diagnosis. Some of these additional tests may include a WBC differential, a blood smear review, or in severe conditions, a bone marrow examination. A differential may inform the doctor as to which type of WBC is low or high while a blood smear and/or bone marrow biopsy can reveal the presence of abnormal and/or immature populations of WBCs.\n\nWhen is it ordered?\nA WBC count is normally ordered as part of the complete blood count (CBC), which may be performed when an individual undergoes a routine health examination. The test may be done when someone has general signs and symptoms of an infection and/or inflammation such as:\n\nFever, chills\nBody aches, pain\nHeadache\nA variety of other signs and symptoms, depending on the site of suspected infection or inflammation\nTesting may be performed when there are signs and symptoms that the doctor thinks may be related to a blood disorder, autoimmune disorder, or an immune deficiency.\n\nA WBC may be ordered often and on a regular basis to monitor an individual who has been diagnosed with an infection, blood or immune disorder or another condition affecting WBCs. It may also been ordered periodically to monitor the effectiveness of treatment or when a particular therapy is known to affect WBCs, such as radiation or chemotherapy.\n\nWhat does the test result mean?\n\n\nA doctor will consider the results of a WBC count together with results from other components of the CBC as well as a number of other factors, such as physical examination, medical history, and signs and symptoms. A WBC count indicates an overall increase or decrease in the number of WBCs but does not determine the specific types of WBCs that are affected. For this, a differential must be performed and evaluated. The results of the differential will give further clues as to the cause of an increase or decrease. In addition, a blood smear may be performed to evaluate the appearance of white blood cells and to determine if abnormal and/or immature cells are present.\n\nA high white blood cell count, called leukocytosis, may result from a number of conditions and diseases. Some examples include:\n\nInfections, most commonly caused by bacteria and some viruses, less commonly by fungi or parasites\nInflammation or inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis or inflammatory bowel disease\nLeukemia, myeloproliferative disorders\nConditions that result in tissue death (necrosis) such as trauma, burns, surgery or heart attack\nAllergic responses (e.g., allergies, asthma)\nIntense exercise\nSevere emotional or physical stress\nPregnancy in the final month and labor may be associated with increased WBC levels.\nA low white blood cell count, called leukopenia, can result from conditions such as:\n\nBone marrow damage (e.g., toxin, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, drugs)\nBone marrow disorders—the bone marrow does not produce sufficient WBCs (e.g., myelodysplastic syndrome, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency)\nLymphoma or other cancer that has spread (metastasized) to the bone marrow\nAutoimmune disorders—the body attacks and destroys its own WBCs (e.g., lupus)\nOverwhelming infections (e.g., sepsis)\nDiseases of the immune system, such as HIV, which destroy T lymphocytes\nWhen WBC counts are used for monitoring purposes, a series of WBC counts that continues to rise or fall to abnormal levels indicates that the condition or disease is getting worse. WBC counts that return to normal indicate improvement and/or successful treatment.\n\nIs there anything else I should know?\nIf you have had your spleen removed, you may have a persistent mild to moderate increase in WBC count.\n\nWBC counts are age-related. On average, normal newborns and infants have higher WBC counts than adults.\n\nIt is not uncommon for the elderly to fail to develop high WBC count (leukocytosis) as a response to infection.\n\nThere are many drugs that cause both increased and decreased WBC counts."

        "commonQuestions": "1. Can I test my hemoglobin at home?\nYes, there are some home tests currently available that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Home testing offers many benefits, but it's also important to recognize the potential tradeoffs between quality and convenience and to take steps to protect yourself against the possibility of false results, and your own lack of training. Talk to your doctor about this type of testing and consult her about any questions or concerns you may have. For more about these tests, see the article With Home Testing, Consumers Take Charge of Their Health.\n^ Back to top\n\n2. Is anyone at greater risk of abnormal hemoglobin levels?\nWomen of childbearing age tend to have lower hemoglobin levels than men due to loss of iron and blood during menstrual periods and increased need for iron during pregnancy. Others who are at greater risk of a low hemoglobin level (anemia) include people with poor nutrition and diets low in iron or vitamins, people who have undergone surgery or have been severely injured, people with chronic conditions such as kidney disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic infection or chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Someone who has family members with a genetic cause of anemia, such as sickle cell or thalassemia, also has a higher risk of having the condition and a higher risk of anemia.\n^ Back to top\n\n3. Are there warning signs for abnormally low hemoglobin levels?\nSome warning signs are fatigue, fainting, pallor, and shortness of breath.\n^ Back to top\n\n4. Can a healthy diet and nutrition help keep optimal hemoglobin levels?\nYes, to the extent that if you eat a well-balanced diet, you can prevent anemia due to a lack of iron, vitamin B12, or folate in the foods you eat. Sometimes use of a supplement is recommended if you are at risk of a vitamin deficiency. However, the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is malabsorption, and the most common cause of iron deficiency is bleeding.

        "patientTestSample": "What is being tested?\nHemoglobin is the iron-containing protein found in all red blood cells (RBCs) that gives the cells their characteristic red color. Hemoglobin enables RBCs to bind to oxygen in the lungs and carry it to tissues and organs throughout the body. It also helps transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a product of cell metabolism, from tissues and organs to the lungs where it is exhaled.\n\nThe hemoglobin test measures the amount of hemoglobin in a person's sample of blood. A hemoglobin level can be performed alone or with a hematocrit, a test that measures the proportion of blood that is made up of RBCs, to quickly evaluate an individual's red blood cells. Red blood cells, which make up about 40% (ranging 37-49%) of the blood's volume, are produced in the bone marrow and are released into the bloodstream after they mature. The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days, and the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding.\n\nSeveral diseases and conditions can affect RBCs and consequently the level of hemoglobin in the blood. In general, the hemoglobin level and hematocrit rise when the number of red blood cells increases. The hemoglobin level and hematocrit fall to less than normal when there is a drop in production of RBCs by the bone marrow, an increase in the destruction of RBCs, or if blood is lost due to bleeding. A drop in the RBC count, hemoglobin and hematocrit can result in anemia, a condition in which tissues and organs in the body do not get enough oxygen, causing fatigue and weakness. If too many RBCs are produced, the blood can become thickened, causing sluggish blood flow and related problems.\n\nHow is the sample collected for testing?\nA blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm or by a fingerstick (for children and adults) or heelstick (for newborns).\n\nNOTE: If undergoing medical tests makes you or someone you care for anxious, embarrassed, or even difficult to manage, you might consider reading one or more of the following articles: Coping with Test Pain, Discomfort, and Anxiety, Tips on Blood Testing, Tips to Help Children through Their Medical Tests, and Tips to Help the Elderly through Their Medical Tests.\n\nAnother article, Follow That Sample, provides a glimpse at the collection and processing of a blood sample and throat culture.\n\nIs any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?\nNo test preparation is needed.",
